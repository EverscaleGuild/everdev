## Quick Start

Get your hands dirty with our great tools:) Follow the [Quick Start](docs/guides/quick-start.md) to get on board of Ever OS Development ASAP!

## Command Line Interface

### Quick start

Start testing your contracts without any delay with this guide. It will help you get test tokens in Developer Network, prepare your environment and test your first contract. [Test my first contract!](docs/guides/work-with-contracts.md)

### General command syntax

```shell
everdev <tool> <command> ...args
```

Some tools (network, signer, contract, js) and commands have short aliases. For example instead of using `everdev network list` you can use `everdev n l` and even shorter `everdev nl`.

Explore the detailed description of command line interface in the corresponding [section](docs/command-line-interface/solidity.md).
